Aim:Design an obstacle detector and distance measuring device. 
Appartus:ultrasonic sensor,arduiono,breadboard,led.
Procedure: 
step1:
Take the Arduino,led and Breadboard.
Step2:
join the ultrasonic sensor s.t all the probs join with the gnd. and VCC of arduino .
Step:
after you put coding ,start the circuit .
Step4:
as how much value you had given to it ,it show the distance and if value is greater than the led glow ,otherwise it will not.
Step5: it starts working as per your code.
Conclusion:
the ultrasonic sensor works and glow the led with the given limit.
